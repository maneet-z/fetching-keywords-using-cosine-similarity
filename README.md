# fetching-keywords-using-cosine-similarity
This Repo explains the implementation of cosine similarity for identifying potential keywords from the corpus of 1000 medical reports associated to various types of cancers.
This code generates the 2 individual files: 1) profile words - the words consisting of important keywords that are important for analysis 2) common words - words which are often repeated in a document and does not contain any special information(Articles as "a,the,is,are,why,who" usually are included in the common words document as they are repeated multiple times)
